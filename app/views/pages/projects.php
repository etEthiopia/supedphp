                        To solve these problems. <br>We developed the digital educational server for the whole

                        reference books.
                        <br>A tablet with grade resources (textbooks and video tutorials) full loaded so as to
                        use them anywhere any time without the need for connection.
                        <br>A wireless network that needs to bridge the resource in the server, which will be
                        installed in the school to the tablet.&nbsp;<br>In the same way, a course based library
                        system is developed for Universities in Ethiopia.<br>

                    Speed school is initiated by Geneva Global. this initiative is piloted and currently
                    implemented in different regions. the workshop made in Debre Zeit has proved its importance
                    if adopted. based on this initiative we are working in assisting the SS with technology.
                    After participating in a workshop, organized by Ministry of Education and Jeneva Global, at
                    Bishoftu Pyramid Hotel on June 11/2018, we have discussed with a concerned body on how to
                    support the speed school through technology-assisted Education program which is introduced
                    by support education. The discussion and the way forward is to be continued with Geneva
                    Global and organizations working in similar projects.</p>
